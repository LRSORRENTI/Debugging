Breakpoints
===========

In the chrome dev tools, under the sources tab 
we can see the index.js file 

If we click on a line number, we can set a break point, 
this will pause execution of our code at that breakpoint 
and let us look around, what values are variables in, 
what our code looks like during that stage of execution 

This can help visualize what a peice of data actually 
looks like at that break point 

And if we look below the callstack option on the right, 
which shows the current function we're paused in, and 
the function which triggered it, aka our event listener 

This is the callstack, or an ordered list of functions
 that have been called to get our application to it's 
 current state 

With very large applications with many moving parts, 
it can be difficult to pin down when functions have 
been called, with the callstack pane in the dev tools 
we can see a play by play, like a slow motion replay 
in football, how we got to this point in our application 

And below the callstack pane is the breakpoints pane, 
which displays our breakpoints, the ones we set, and 
the line numbers for them

Many apps can have tens, or even hundreds of breakpoints 
to see how functions are being called during execution

If you right click on a breakpoint, dev tools provides 
many options to disable or change breakpoints

And if we hover over values, we can 
see the prototype chain
