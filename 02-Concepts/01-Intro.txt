==================
Debugging Concepts
==================

In this section we'll learn more about breakpoints, 
callstacks, logging, and source maps 

These are components used during Debugging that 
we'll learn to use 

These tools enable us to view an application's state 
during runtime, or when it's halted 

===========
Breakpoints
===========

Breakpoints give us execution control which halt 
program execution at specific places earmarked 
within the program code structure 

The visibility of the application state is provided 
in various views, most common being hover views
and callstack tracing

=======
Logging
=======

We use console.log statements at places in our code 
to view the value of a variable, as a compliment 
to breakpoints, logging provides custom ways to display 
state as the application code is executed

===========
Source Maps
===========

Source maps allow us to debug minified libraries, 
like webpack, we can enable source maps which map 
minified code back to their source code state 

It allows us to debug minfied code, min.js files 

=======
Console
=======

Utilizing the console goes beyond console.log, the 
console can be used to provide state info, which can 
be difficult to find in other toolset views 

It can also be used as a quick code editor for testing
