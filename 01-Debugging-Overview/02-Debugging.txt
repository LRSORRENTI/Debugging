Debugging
=========

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving 
defects or problems within the program that 
prevent correct operation of computer software 
or a system 

Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging 
control flow analysis, unit testing, intergration 
testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the 
application or system level. memory dumps and 
profiling

The scope of this course doesn't include unit tests, 
or integration tests, but we'll dive deep into 
interactive debugging

Chrome browswer provides robust, and widely used 
developer tools to assist in the debugging process,
and in this course we'll utilize them

Debugging protocol: 

- Unit and intergration tests are failing, analyzing 
  the failures of these tests is one step 

- Console output analysis, carefully reading any 
  errors logged to the console

- Using DevTools like inside of Chrome to dig deeper
  and get a view on our app state, as the code throws 
  exceptions and errors
