JavaScript Debugging Tools

=====
TESTS
===== 

Unit, End-To-End, and Integration tests are outside 
of the scope of this course, but it's important to 
have a base level understanding of them 

They are usually the first line of defense against 
bugs in a development environment

When tests are done after bundling / compiles finish, 
the test themselves provide some feedback to the 
effects the changes to the codebase made 

Outside of code anaylysis, tests are the first line 
of defense against bugs, failures, and errors 

=======
Logging
=======

Console logs can become robust tools if we craft them
carefully

File logging is not as handy, as files need  accessed 
and scanned prior to providing value 

=================
JavaScript Errors
=================

JavaScript itself provides feedback at runtime through 
it's error throwing capabilities, using try, catch blocks
and custom error messages is another tool to 
find bugs
