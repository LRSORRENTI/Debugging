Introduction
============

In this course we'll learn and practice common 
debugging patterns to find and fix bugs, and 
how to utilize the best tools to assist in 
debugging 

We'll go over error messages in depth, how to 
step through our code line by line interactively,
this will give us a peek inside what every variable 
and function is doing during execution

Learning how to utilize the debugger effectively, 
and understanding how patterns of bugs can arise, 
we can in turn facilitate cleaner, and less 
error prone code

=========

=========
Section 3 
=========

- The Process 

- More breakpoint types 

- Working inside the console 

- Replicating a bug to determine validity / scope 

- Visually inspecting the source code for errors 

- Looking for valuable console log outputs

- Using strategically placed breakpoints to halt our code 

- Using a Watch on what we perceive to be a pertinent 
  value in application code 

- Applying a trial fix within the source tab's code, 
  saving it and running the code againt to test it 

- Applying a proven fix in our actual source code 
  and testing it in the browswer
